### More Info
 
Remember to set your own password. Dont leave the one I have set, this is just for example.

DONT FORGET PASSWORD, DISABLES CTRL+ALT+DELETE

'For Windows 98, does not seem to work for win2000 or NT.

The first three lines of the declaration and the disableCtrlAltDel function only remove the program from showing up under CTRL+ALT+DEL. It really isnt needed but incase someone manages to do this as windows loads, they would be able to cancel it from starting.
